Instructions

The Express server is already complete. Create 3 endpoints. Then write middleware that logs the endpoint to the console when visited. Only include the middleware on 2 of the 3 endpoints. Build your TypeScript project and confirm that your logger works on the build.

Example: "/countries was visited"

NOTE: a popup of "Renderer Failure: tsconfig.json" may open when starting this project. It is safe to ignore this error. Error is due to the comments in tsconfig.json not being considered valid JSON; however, it is generally considered safe to place comments in JSON config files.

 dont forget 
npm install -g ts-node
